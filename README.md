#Memory Board
###Memory is a ruby on rails web application that allows users to create memory boards where they can gather event pictures from friends and families. Each board comes with a randomly generated 16-digits code, which can be given to friends and families as an access code. Once enter the code, invited users can upload the event pictures to the memory board collaboratively.
